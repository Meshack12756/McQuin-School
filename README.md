# McQuin-School
McQuin School is an initiative dedicated to providing free programming resources to students. Currently in its early stages of development, the project is built using modern web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To enhance the user experience, the front-end will leverage robust frameworks such as React.js or Vue.js for dynamic and responsive interfaces.

A back-end system is also in development, with plans to integrate powerful technologies such as Node.js with Express.js, Django (Python), or FastAPI to ensure scalability, security, and efficient data management. Database solutions like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or MySQL will be implemented to store and manage learning resources effectively.

As the project evolves, I aim to integrate cutting-edge technologies and collaborate with like-minded individuals to maximize its impact. By prioritizing fundamental learning principles, McQuin School is committed to delivering high-quality educational resources and fostering an optimal learning environment for students.
